# HW1_C
Solving C++ tasks.
Nadezhda Chekulaeva and Anastasia Shatikova, group 21BI1.
For each task, we created a separate function in which we specified what it should do and commented on what was happening.
The functions used different loops, arithmetic operations and solution methods.
In the main() function, we would write the task number, call the function and mark the answer.
