# HW1_C
Solving C++ tasks.
Nadezhda Chekulaeva and Anastasia Shatikova, group 21BI1.
For each task, we created a separate function in which we specified what it should do and commented on what was happening.
The functions used different loops, arithmetic operations and solution methods.
In the main() function, we would write the task number, call the function and mark the answer.
In the first tasks, we took and passed parameters from main() to the function, but then we decided to create and take variables in the function itself, so in the last tasks we only called the function in the main function and wrote the task number.
